# CERIF-DataModel

The **C**ommon **E**uropean **R**esearch **I**nformation **F**ormat (= CERIF) is a flexible data model 
for representing research information (i.e., information about research). 
It was developed and is being maintained by [http://www.eurocris.org/](euroCRIS).

This project contains the Entity-Relationship model of CERIF.
The model is documented in the [./documentation/](documentation) directory: 
start browsing with the [./documentation/MInfo.html](documentation/MInfo.html) file.

The model is currently maintained using the [https://www.quest.com/products/toad-data-modeler/](TOAD Data Modeler) tool.
The file in the XML-based format resides in the [./model/CERIF.txp](model/CERIF.txp) file.

The primary aim for the CERIF model is to support information interchange in the research domain.
We are in the process of building tools to allow all interested parties create their own **CERIF profile**: 
a specific subset of CERIF and a specific set of semantic vocabularies.
When ready, there will be a fellow project here.

We also support publishing of research information as Linked Open Data.
The CERIF RDF will be brough up-to-date with the CERIF model itself 
and placed in another fellow project.
